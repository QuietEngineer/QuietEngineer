# About Me

Hi, I am QuietEngineer.
Sometimes I do stuff.
I am a professional Software Engineer.

My current obsessions include:

- Open Source Software 
- Security
- Privacy
- Law

I'm a constant learner, always excited to dive into a new topic.
My curiosity and determination assist me when I tackle ambitious projects.
I hope to create and contribute to some cool projects in the future.

## Skills

I am most comfortable with programming using Python, Kotlin, and Go.
Besides those, I have dabbled in other languages including Haskell and Swift.
I enjoy reading documentation such as language reference pages to learn about their idioms and approaches to problems.
I especially tend to enjoy languages and tools with good documentation.

Most of my professional experience has been in DevOps and infrastructure. 


## Cool Tools

These are things that I think are pretty neat:

- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/): Tool to convert between markup formats. I especially like using it for markdown to $\LaTeX$
- [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/): Hardened and open source mobile operating system based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP)
